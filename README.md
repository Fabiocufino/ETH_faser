Master thesis project at ETHZ under Prof. Sgalaberna neutrino group. \

This project focuses on advancing event reconstruction techniques for the FASER neutrino
detection framework by leveraging both conventional algorithms and deep learning methods
in parallel. The FASER experiment at CERN, is designed to detect high-energy neutrinos
produced in particle collisions at the LHC. It operates in the forward direction along the
beamline, covering a region where other detectors are typically blind. FASERÎ½ can detect
neutrinos of all three flavors and is capable of observing interactions in the TeV energy range,
which is unprecedented for collider neutrinos. The primary goal of the project is to develop
the reconstruction from scratch while addressing challenges such as hit/event classification
and noise suppression. The study will enable precise measurements and contribute to future
physics analyses. This work aims to establish a robust computational foundation for high-
energy neutrino physics and detector validation.
